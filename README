## **CS457 Assignment 1 Server Client Key Exchange**
---------------------------
### INTRODUCTION
In this assignment you are going to develop, step-by-step, a simple symmetric key
exchange mechanism, using C, for a secure chat server/client scenario, using the
OpenSSL toolkit. The purpose of this assignment is to provide you the opportunity
to get familiar with public key (RSA) and symmetric key (AES) cryptography and the
very popular general-purpose cryptography toolkit, OpenSSL. Also,you will be able
to acquire hands-on experience in implementing simple cryptographic applications.
The tool will provide RSA encryption/decryption in order to exchange AES keys and
establish a secure communication channel using the OpenSSL toolkit. Once the secure
channel is established, the server and the client can securely communicate using
encrypted messages.

### **IMPORTANT:**
The default server port is 3613. However, if many students execute the server on
the same CSD machine this will be a conflict. If you run your server on CSD's
machines, change the port with your AM, as stated in the exercise description.

### DEBUG MODE:
If you want to run it in debug mode uncomment the #define DEBUG line in cs457_crypto.c
for a more verbose output
---------------------------

Sample Execution:

tty1 $ ./Server/server [-p <port>]

tty2 $ ./Client/client -i 127.0.0.1 -p 3613 -m hello_friend


## **CS457 Assignment 2 AccessControl Logging Tool**

### Introduction
In this assignment you are going to develop in C, an ​access control logging system​. This system will keep track of all file accesses and modifications. Every
such operation will generate an entry in a log file, stored for further investigation by a separate high privileged process. For this assignment you will need to
use LD_PRELOAD which gives the ability to instruct the linker to bind symbols provided by a shared library before other libraries. This way, you are going to override
the C standard library functions that handle file accesses and modifications (fopen,fwrite) with your own versions in order to extend their functionality. You will
also test your logging system against a ransomware, so your access control logging needs to be able to detect ransomware behavior.


### Event Logging
#### ToDo
- Add fingerprint field in log file (MD5 Hashing)
- Make fopen and fwrite log field display failure whenever a function fails for whatever reason
- Print correct filename and path in log file when calling fwrite

#### Running
In order to run demo with the modified shared object you need to type the following command:
	LD_PRELOAD=./logger.so ./demo
