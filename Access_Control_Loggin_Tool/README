#Introduction
In this assignment you are going to develop in C, an ​access control logging system​. This system will keep track of all file accesses and modifications. Every
such operation will generate an entry in a log file, stored for further investigation by a separate high privileged process. For this assignment you will need to
use LD_PRELOAD which gives the ability to instruct the linker to bind symbols provided by a shared library before other libraries. This way, you are going to override
the C standard library functions that handle file accesses and modifications (fopen,fwrite) with your own versions in order to extend their functionality. You will
also test your logging system against a ransomware, so your access control logging needs to be able to detect ransomware behavior.


# Event Logging
## ToDo
- Add fingerprint field in log file (MD5 Hashing)
- Make fopen and fwrite log field display failure whenever a function fails for whatever reason
- Print correct filename and path in log file when calling fwrite

## Running
In order to run demo with the modified shared object you need to type the following command:
	LD_PRELOAD=./logger.so ./demo
