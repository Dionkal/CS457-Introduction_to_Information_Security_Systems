CS457 Assignment 1 Solution
---------------------------
#INTRODUCTION
In this assignment you are going to develop, step-by-step, a simple symmetric key
exchange mechanism, using C, for a secure chat server/client scenario, using the
OpenSSL toolkit. The purpose of this assignment is to provide you the opportunity
to get familiar with public key (RSA) and symmetric key (AES) cryptography and the
very popular general-purpose cryptography toolkit, OpenSSL. Also,you will be able
to acquire hands-on experience in implementing simple cryptographic applications.
The tool will provide RSA encryption/decryption in order to exchange AES keys and
establish a secure communication channel using the OpenSSL toolkit. Once the secure
channel is established, the server and the client can securely communicate using
encrypted messages.

#IMPORTANT:
The default server port is 3613. However, if many students execute the server on
the same CSD machine this will be a conflict. If you run your server on CSD's
machines, change the port with your AM, as stated in the exercise description.
---------------------------

Sample Execution:

tty1 $ ./server [-p <port>]

tty2 $ ./Client/client -i 127.0.0.1 -p 3613 -m hello friend
